abstract = {The modern scientific data processing is not only a collection of powerful algorithms but also a whole infrastructure of facilities for data reading, processing, and results output. As the amount of data grows, so grows a need for automation of the process. The proper automation requires not only improvement of existing frameworks, but also a search of new ways to organize data processing in a way it could be automated and parallelized. DataForge experimental framework solves some problems by making the analysis configuration declarative instead of imperative. In this article, we present a limited demonstration of the idea applied to “Troitsk nu-mass” experiment in the search for sterile neutrino.},
